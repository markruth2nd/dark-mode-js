# dark-mode-js
Dark mode switch using Figma, JavaScript & animeJS


## Introduction

The purpose of this project is so that I have a quick light / dark mode repository to refer to for future projects moving forward. It is a simple project where the user will see a sun in the middle of the page and a title of Dark Mode. All the user needs to do is clock on the sun for it to switch to dark mode which includes the full page turning black and then the sun will animate into a simple moon.

## Features

When the page first loads, the back ground will be grey and the tile advising Dark mode, so as soon as the user clicks the sun, the page will go dark and then the sun will animate into a moon and rotate 320ยบ.

## Installation

Instead of NPM installing animeJS, I simply downloaded the anime.min.js file from the link provided in Github(https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/) and pasted the file into myproject. This is so that I did note need to add package.json files as well as a node modules folder.
